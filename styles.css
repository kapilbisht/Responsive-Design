Responsive Design

“Responsive design” refers to the idea that-
your website should display equally well in everything from widescreen monitors to mobile phones.
It’s an approach to web design and development that eliminates the distinction between the mobile-friendly version of your website
and its desktop counterpart. With responsive design, they’re the same thing.
